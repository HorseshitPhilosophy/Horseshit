## Abstract 

Primordics is a new philosophical framework that introduces qualia and ligans as the primitives of awareness, explains how apprehensions (cyclic ligan-closures) and abstractions (token-stabilizations) emerge from them, diagnoses paradox as reference-flattening (generalizing the boundary phenomenon exemplified by Gödel), and redefines philosophy’s aim as conceptual homeostasis rather than truth or universality.

## Definitions

### Def. 1 — Awareness
Awareness refers to subjective experience itself—the condition in which anything appears “for” someone. It is not a thing or an object but the field of lived presence in which all contents of experience arise. Awareness does not consist of discrete entities, nor does it presuppose distinctions such as inner and outer, subject and object, or self and world. To say “there is awareness” is to point to the fact that there is something it is like to undergo experience, irrespective of how that experience may later be described, categorized, or explained.

---

### Def. 2 — Qualia
Qualia are the felt textures of awareness as they are directly given. A quale might be the brightness of a color, the sharpness of a sound, the warmth of a touch, or the heaviness of a mood. They are not classifications such as “red” or “sad,” which belong to abstraction, but the immediate phenomena as they present themselves. Within Primordics, qualia are treated as the elemental features of experience: not analyzable into smaller experiential parts, yet variable in countless ways.

---

### Def. 3 — Ligan
A ligan is a unidirectional connection that links one quale to another, or links a quale to an already existing ligan. It is the most basic form of association within experience, expressing the tendency of certain phenomena to lead into or be bound with others. Ligans are not concepts or labels; they are pre-conceptual linkages that arise simply as a feature of lived flow. For example, the sound of a mother’s voice may become connected with the feeling of comfort, not by reasoning but by the natural binding of one experience to another.

---

### Def. 4 — Apprehension
An apprehension occurs when ligans connect into a cycle, producing a minimally stable configuration. Such cycles provide a rudimentary sense of recognition: the impression that something encountered now is “like” something encountered before. Apprehensions are not yet concepts, categories, or words; they are proto-structures of recognition that precede those. They allow experience to hold together in repeating patterns without the need for explicit tokens or formal classification.

---

### Def. 5 — Abstraction
An abstraction is formed when an apprehension is stabilized by a repeatable token, such as a word, an image, or a gesture. Through tokenization, apprehensions acquire persistence and can be recalled, shared, and combined into larger structures. Abstractions make possible systematic thought and communication, as well as the distinctions—such as subject and object, internal and external, existence and non-existence—that characterize reflective philosophy. In this sense, abstraction is the threshold between pre-conceptual recognition and the articulated conceptual world. Tokens may be atomic (markers) or composite (constructions). Indication is the act of pointing to an expression; every indication presupposes a frame of indication beyond the indicated expression. Indexing is the use of tokens to mark transitions within the flow, partitioning them into reproducible positions; indexing enables ordered sequences and explicit recall.

---

### Def. 6 — Primordic Reconstruction
Primordic reconstruction is the reflective activity of using abstractions to model or describe the primordial base of awareness, qualia, and ligans. Because reconstruction must make use of abstractions, it cannot replicate the base exactly; it yields only partial and simplified representations. Nonetheless, these reconstructions are diagnostically valuable, for they reveal the structural conditions that precede and underlie abstraction itself. Within Primordics, reconstruction is both the method and the acknowledgment of the limits of any method.

## Axioms

### Ax. 0 — Contextual Affixation
**Statement.** In Primordics, primitives such as awareness, qualia, and ligans are introduced axiomatically for diagnostic purposes. Their meanings are bound strictly to the definitions within the system and do not presuppose external usages or universality.

**Explication.** The framework of Primordics depends on the careful introduction of its primitives as structural constructs. These constructs are not metaphysical ultimates but scaffolding elements designed to render the primordial base intelligible. The choice of words such as “awareness” and “qualia” is conventional; they point to stipulated functions within the system, not to pregiven truths. This axiom ensures that Primordics operates on its own terms and maintains internal coherence.

---

### Ax. 1 — Primordial Flow
**Statement.** The primordial base is not absolute nothingness but a continuous flow of qualia, within which ligans arise as associations.

**Explication.** Absolute nothingness is not given in experience and therefore cannot serve as the basis for a diagnostic ontology. Instead, what is always encountered at the base is presence: the arising and shifting of qualia. Within this ongoing stream, relations form as ligans, linking one quale to another. The primordial condition is therefore one of ceaseless appearance and relation, a field of immediacy rather than void.

---

### Ax. 2 — Minimal Ontology
**Statement.** The ontology of Primordics consists only of qualia and ligans as primitives, from which all further structures are derived.

**Explication.** By positing only qualia and ligans as primitives, Primordics establishes a minimal framework sufficient to explain more complex structures without proliferating entities. Apprehensions arise from cycles of ligans, and abstractions arise when apprehensions are stabilized by tokens. This economy of primitives ensures parsimony while enabling systematic elaboration. The minimal ontology functions as the ground upon which the diagnostic method is built.

---

### Ax. 3 — Monism
**Statement.** At the primordial level, no distinctions such as internal versus external, subject versus object, or mental versus material appear. The primordial field is monistic.

**Explication.** Distinctions that structure later thought and discourse do not belong to the primordial base. Before token-stabilized abstraction, there is only undivided presence. The oppositions of subject and object, internal and external, and other dualities are themselves emergent products of abstraction. The primordial field, as accessed through reconstruction, is thus a unity in which such oppositions have not yet arisen. Monism denies ontic dualisms (subject/object, inner/outer) but allows internal structural differentiations such as transitions and retentive asymmetries. These are variations of one field, not separations into two kinds of being.

---

### Ax. 4 — Light Networks
**Statement.** Primordial ligan configurations form networks that may close locally into apprehensions, but they are not stabilized by tokens and therefore remain light.

**Explication.** Apprehensions arise when ligans form cycles that reinforce recognition across qualia. Yet in the absence of tokens, these networks lack permanence and systematic elaboration. They are fragile, shifting, and transitory—light structures that support pre-conceptual patterning but not abstraction. This distinction clarifies how recognition can occur prior to linguistic or symbolic stabilization, while remaining structurally distinct from abstraction.

---

### Ax. 5 — Emergence
**Statement.** Distinctions such as self and other, agency and passivity, or existence and non-existence arise only with abstraction and are not present in the primordial base.

**Explication.** The primordial field, while structured by ligans and apprehensions, does not yet contain the higher-level categories that dominate reflective thought. The recognition of oneself as an agent, the contrast between inner and outer, and the claim that something exists or does not exist all require token stabilization. These distinctions therefore emerge only at the level of abstraction and cannot be treated as primitives.

---

### Ax. 6 — Pragmatic Universality
**Statement.** For beings whose abstractions arise from awareness, the path of abstraction must trace back through apprehensions structured by qualia and ligans.

**Explication.** This axiom specifies the conditional scope of Primordics. Where abstraction originates in subjective awareness, it must emerge from the same basic structures of qualia and ligans. Apprehensions, as cyclic closures of ligans, provide the immediate substrate upon which token stabilization operates. This necessity is pragmatic rather than absolute, for the structure is diagnostic of awareness-based abstraction rather than universally legislating for all possible modes of being.

---

### Ax. 7 — Reflexivity
**Statement.** Primordics is itself a primordic reconstruction. As an abstraction about the primordial base, it is necessarily distorted, yet this distortion does not negate its diagnostic value.

**Explication.** Any attempt to describe or model the primordial base requires abstraction. Such abstraction cannot perfectly capture the base, but this incompleteness is structural rather than accidental. Reflexivity is therefore built into Primordics itself: it is a system that acknowledges its own limits while still generating valid diagnostic insights. The acceptance of distortion as intrinsic allows Primordics to operate without collapsing under charges of self-reference.

---

### Ax. 8 — No Absolute Abstractions
**Statement.** No abstraction is absolute; every stabilized structure is context-dependent and contingent upon ligan networks.

**Explication.** Abstractions gain their apparent stability through tokenization and reinforcement within networks of ligans. Yet these stabilizations are always partial and situated. To treat any abstraction as absolute is to conflate its contingent stability with primordial necessity. By rejecting absolute abstraction, Primordics preserves the diagnostic distinction between the base and its emergent structures, clarifying why disagreements and paradoxes arise when abstractions are misrecognized as absolutes.

---

### Ax. 9 — Intrinsic Transitionality
**Statement.** The primordial field (awareness) is intrinsically differential: presence is given as local transitions (“deltas”) in the activation of qualia and ligans, not as an all-at-once simultaneity. These transitions are modulations within a single field and do not presuppose a global before/after order.

**Explication.** A transition is a minimal contrastive shift in how qualia and ligans are activated. Treating transition as intrinsic preserves monism: no subject/object or inner/outer is introduced—only internal variation of one field. A global temporal order (before/after, metric time) arises later when transitions are indexed by stabilized expressions (tokens) and coupled with retention traces into sequences. At the pre-index level, continuity is a feel of adjacency across transitions rather than a measured order.

---

### Ax. 10 — Retentive Asymmetry
**Statement.** The primordial field exhibits selective carry-forward: traces of prior activation persist asymmetrically across transitions. This carry-forward is partial and biasing rather than representational, enabling proto-recognition and salience without presupposing explicit memory.

**Explication.** Retentive asymmetry is a residual sensitivity of ligan configurations shaped by recent activation (a kind of hysteresis). It affords “holding patterns” at the level of apprehension without tokens. With tokenization, these residuals are shaped into explicit memory and ordered chronology; without it, they remain non-metric biases that make similarity, recurrence, and drift possible.

## Lemmas

### Lemma 1 — Dependence of Structure
**From Def. 1 (Awareness), Def. 2 (Qualia), Def. 3 (Ligans), and Ax. 2 (Minimal Ontology):**
* All higher structures—apprehensions, abstractions, and reconstructions—depend on qualia and ligans as their basis.
* Without the primitives of qualia (contents) and ligans (associations), no further construction is possible.

---

### Lemma 2 — Non-derivability of Awareness
**From Def. 1 (Awareness) and Ax. 1 (Primordial Flow):**
* Awareness cannot be derived from abstractions, since abstractions presuppose awareness as their field of appearance.
* Attempts to “explain away” awareness collapse into circularity, because the act of explanation itself already presumes awareness.

---

### Lemma 3 — Cyclic Recognition
**From Def. 3 (Ligans), Def. 4 (Apprehensions), and Ax. 4 (Light Networks):**
* Recognition first arises when ligans close into cycles (apprehensions).
* These cycles generate a minimal sense of “this is like that” prior to any linguistic token or category.
* Apprehensions thus constitute the first stable proto-patterns within awareness.

---

### Lemma 4 — Token Stabilization
**From Def. 4 (Apprehensions), Def. 5 (Abstractions), and Ax. 5 (Emergence):**
* Abstractions are formed when apprehensions are stabilized by repeatable tokens (words, images, gestures).
* Tokens allow apprehensions to be reinforced, recalled, and shared.
* This stabilization is the threshold where pre-conceptual recognition becomes systematic thought.

---

### Lemma 5 — Emergent Distinctions
**From Ax. 3 (Monism) and Ax. 5 (Emergence):**
* Distinctions such as subject/object, self/other, internal/external, or existence/non-existence emerge only at the level of abstraction.
* These distinctions are not present in the primordial base, where awareness is monistic and undivided.

---

### Lemma 6 — Contextual Dependency
**From Ax. 6 (Pragmatic Universality) and Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions):**
* Every abstraction is context-dependent: its stability derives from reinforcement within ligan networks.
* Abstractions never carry absolute status; they persist or dissolve depending on the dynamics of the networks that support them.

---

### Lemma 7 — Memory as Partial Carry-Forward
**From Ax. 9 (Intrinsic Transitionality), Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry), and Def. 4 (Apprehension)/Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* What persists across transitions is partial and asymmetric: residual tendencies in ligan connections remain without amounting to a full replay of prior qualia.
* In light of these residuals, present qualia are taken as akin to or unlike earlier episodes, making both recognition and error possible.
* Salience emerges where residual tendencies cohere into recurring patterns (apprehensions); with tokenization these coherences support explicit recall.

---

### Lemma 8 — From Transitions to Order
**From Ax. 9 (Intrinsic Transitionality), Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry), and Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* At the primordial level, presence is given as local transitions within a single field, not as a global, all-at-once sequence.
* Ordered before/after relations arise when transitions are indexed by tokens and coupled with retentive traces into reproducible sequences, enabling explicit comparison, recall, and learning.
* Absent such indexing, continuity is a felt adjacency across transitions rather than a measured order; chronology is an emergent product of abstraction, not a primitive.

---

### Lemma 9 — Reflexive Distortion
**From Def. 6 (Primordic Reconstruction) and Ax. 7 (Reflexivity):**
* Primordic reconstruction uses abstractions to model the primordial base.
* Because abstraction is always partial, reconstructions necessarily distort what they model.
* Distortion is structural, not accidental; it defines the boundary conditions of any reflexive system.

---

### Lemma 10 — Dissolution of Absolutism
**From Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions) and Ax. 6 (Pragmatic Universality):**
* Since abstractions are stabilized only within ligan networks, none can be regarded as absolute.
* Apparent absolutes are the effect of high stability and reinforcement within a given network.
* The search for timeless or universal truths is therefore a pseudo-problem: what matters is the pragmatic endurance of stabilized patterns.

---

### Lemma 11 — Emergence of Self
**From Ax. 5 (Emergence) and Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* The sense of self arises only when abstractions stabilize apprehensions into repeatable tokens that can demarcate continuity.
* “Self” as a category depends on contrast with “other” and thus emerges with abstraction, not in the primordial base.

---

### Lemma 12 — Emergence of Agency
**From Ax. 5 (Emergence), Def. 5 (Abstraction), and Lemma 8 (From Transitions to Order):**
* Agency requires ordered sequences (a usable before/after) and abstraction (a stabilized “I” or equivalent marker).
* Without tokens and indexing, events occur within awareness but are not owned by an agent.
* Agency is therefore an emergent abstraction, not a primitive.

---

### Lemma 13 — Semantic Drift
**From Ax. 9 (Intrinsic Transitionality), Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry), and Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* Because carry-forward is partial and asymmetric, successive transitions alter the salience of the ligan connections a token tends to recruit.
* Token-based indexing consolidates some alignments while allowing others to loosen; across transitions these alterations accumulate.
* Meanings therefore evolve as a token’s operative ligan surround shifts; drift is structural and expected, not a usage error.


---

### Lemma 14 — Error as Mis-salience
**From Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry), Ax. 9 (Intrinsic Transitionality), and Def. 4 (Apprehension):**
* Errors occur when partial carry-forward and local transitions bias recognition toward a resemblance that does not hold.
* Salient but partial resemblances can mislead abstraction into false identifications.
* Error is not an anomaly but an inherent feature of partial retention within temporally structured awareness.

---

### Lemma 15 — Normativity as Stabilization
**From Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions) and Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* Norms (truth, morality, correctness) emerge from stabilized abstractions within ligan networks.
* Their apparent force arises from reinforcement and reproducibility, not from absoluteness.
* Normativity is contingent stabilization, not metaphysical necessity.

---

### Lemma 16 — Science as Tokened Iteration
**From Def. 5 (Abstraction), Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions), and Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry):**
* Scientific method is the systematic stabilization of abstractions through repeatable procedures (tokens).
* Its reliability comes from iteration and reinforcement, not from access to absolutes.
* Science is thus a highly effective ligan network, but not a guarantor of metaphysical truth.

---

### Lemma 17 — Logic as Network Constraint
**From Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions) and Def. 5 (Abstraction):**
* Logical rules are abstractions that constrain how tokens may be combined without collapse of stability.
* They are not absolute laws of reality but codifications of consistent token operations.
* Logic is the internal grammar of stabilized ligan networks.

---

### Lemma 18 — Mathematics as Idealized Abstraction
**From Def. 5 (Abstraction), Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions), and Ax. 9 (Intrinsic Transitionality):**
* Mathematics emerges from abstractions purified of sensory qualia, stabilized into symbolic tokens.
* It operates as an idealized ligan system where salience and drift are minimized.
* Mathematical “truths” are stable network invariants, not metaphysical absolutes.

---

### Lemma 19 — Philosophy as Reconstruction
**From Def. 6 (Primordic Reconstruction), Ax. 7 (Reflexivity), and Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions):**
* Philosophy is the reflective reconstruction of the primordial base through abstraction.
* It is structurally partial and distorted but diagnostically clarifies how abstractions arise.
* The true function of philosophy is not discovering absolutes, but maintaining conceptual homeostasis.

---

### Lemma 20 — Pseudo-problems as Category Mistakes
**From Ax. 3 (Monism), Ax. 5 (Emergence), and Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions):**
* Many traditional philosophical disputes (e.g. realism vs. idealism, mind vs. body) are pseudo-problems.
* They mistake emergent abstractions for primitives, or treat abstractions as absolutes.
* When categories are returned to their proper structural level, the apparent intractability dissolves.

---
### Lemma 21 — Relativization of Truth
**From Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions) and Lemma 15 (Normativity as Stabilization):**
* What is called “truth” functions as a stabilized abstraction within ligan networks.
* Apparent absolutes arise from strong reinforcement and reproducibility, not from metaphysical necessity.
* Truth is therefore relative to context and stability, not absolute.

---

### Lemma 22 — Relativization of Meaning
**From Ax. 10 (Retentive Asymmetry), Lemma 13 (Semantic Drift), and Lemma 6 (Contextual Dependency):**
* Meaning is shaped by the shifting associations of tokens within evolving ligan networks.
* Because memory is partial and reinforcement varies, meanings change over time.
* No abstraction holds fixed meaning across all contexts; meaning is inherently fluid.

---

### Lemma 23 — Communication as Token Sharing
**From Def. 5 (Abstraction), Ax. 6 (Pragmatic Universality), and Lemma 22 (Relativization of Meaning):**
* Communication occurs when abstractions stabilized by tokens are shared between networks of different subjects.
* Misunderstanding arises when token associations diverge, producing distinct meanings in each network.
* Communication is successful to the degree that ligan structures overlap sufficiently to stabilize shared reference.

---

### Lemma 24 — Disagreement as Divergent Stabilization
**From Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions), Lemma 6 (Contextual Dependency), and Lemma 23 (Communication):**
* Disagreement occurs when distinct networks stabilize different abstractions under the same or similar tokens.
* Each side may treat its stabilized abstraction as absolute, generating conflict.
* Recognizing the contextual nature of stabilization reframes disagreement as divergence rather than contradiction.

---

### Lemma 25 — Philosophy’s Proper Goal
**From Lemma 19 (Philosophy as Reconstruction) and Ax. 7 (Reflexivity):**
* Philosophy’s proper aim is not the discovery of universal truths but the cultivation of conceptual homeostasis.
* By tracing abstractions back to the primordial base, philosophy clarifies their dependencies and dissolves pseudo-problems.
* This stabilizing function is diagnostic rather than prescriptive.

---

### Lemma 26 — Quietism as Resolution
**From Lemma 20 (Pseudo-problems as Category Mistakes) and Ax. 7 (Reflexivity):**
* Many philosophical disputes are resolved not by choosing one side but by diagnosing the dispute as a misplacement of categories.
* The resolution lies in recognizing the pseudo-problem and ceasing to treat it as substantive.
* Quietism is thus a natural outcome of Primordic diagnosis.

---

### Lemma 27 — Limits of Universality
**From Ax. 6 (Pragmatic Universality) and Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions):**
* Primordics applies conditionally: wherever abstraction arises from awareness, its structures trace back through qualia and ligans.
* Outside this scope, claims of universality cannot be made.
* This conditional universality prevents overextension into metaphysical absolutism.

---

### Lemma 28 — Scientific Knowledge as Map, Not Territory
**From Lemma 16 (Science as Tokened Iteration), Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions), and Ax. 7 (Reflexivity):**
* Science produces maps: stabilized, tokenized abstractions that model regularities in awareness and the world.
* These maps are effective because they iterate and reinforce stability, not because they reproduce the primordial base.
* Confusing the map for the territory is a category mistake that inflates abstractions into absolutes.

---

### Lemma 29 — Incompatibility as Non-refutation
**From Ax. 6 (Pragmatic Universality), Ax. 0 (Contextual Affixation), and Lemma 24 (Disagreement as Divergent Stabilization):**
* If a subject rejects Primordics, this does not refute the system but reflects non-resonance of their abstraction network with Primordic reconstruction.
* Compatibility is contingent, not necessary; non-acceptance is an expected outcome of divergence, not a logical contradiction.

---

### Lemma 30 — Paradox Dissolution
**From Ax. 7 (Reflexivity), Ax. 8 (No Absolute Abstractions), Ax. 9–10 (Intrinsic Transitionality/Retentive Asymmetry), and Lemma 11 (Emergence of Self):**
1. **Strata.** Primordics distinguishes: (a) the primordial field (qualia/ligans), (b) apprehensions (pre-conceptual patterns), (c) abstractions/tokens, and (d) reconstructions (meta-level descriptions and adjudication).
2. **No pure self-reference.** What appears as “self-reference” at any stratum in fact depends on an indication frame supplied by another stratum; it is co-reference. Apparent “self-reference” becomes paradoxical only when this frame is flattened into the same stratum.
3. **Reclassification of cases.**
   * Liar-style sentences are frame-flattenings (category mistakes).
   * Gödel-style sentences, under a formal reconstruction, are boundary markers of internal adjudication, not paradoxes.
4. **Diagnostic rule.** If an expression both (i) sets eligibility conditions for a stratum and (ii) purports to evaluate its own eligibility within that same stratum, reclassify it as a boundary case: evaluate it at the reconstruction level or revise the local criteria.
5. **Resolution norm.** Boundary cases are handled by stratification or revision: either elevate the assessment to reconstruction, or refine the abstraction/tokens so the indication frame is explicit. In neither path is an absolute contradiction required.

## Conclusion

Primordics approaches philosophy as a practice of inconsistency robustness: the recognition that our worldviews are dynamic networks of concepts that inevitably encounter edge cases, breakdowns, and disagreements. Rather than treating such breakdowns as failures to reach a final truth, Primordics treats them as natural signals for repair and refinement. Just as software debugging or mathematical foundation-building thrives by adjusting when inconsistencies arise, so too do our personal and collective conceptual systems remain resilient by adapting, not by securing absolutes.

On this view, philosophy is not about discovering universal foundations but about achieving conceptual homeostasis within the shifting networks of meanings we inhabit. Every person with awareness already participates in this process: we each negotiate our own conceptual balance, shaped by experience, language, and interaction with others. Academic philosophy is simply one minority form of this wider human activity. Its frequent fixation on universality or consensus mistakes the proper function of philosophy, which is not to legislate eternal truths, but to help individuals stabilize and repair their own networks of understanding.

Accordingly, notions like “truth” and “meaning” are not absolutes but pragmatic stabilizations—tokens reinforced within certain contexts that work well enough until they drift, fracture, or clash. Disagreement arises when different networks stabilize different resolutions, and paradox arises when levels of reference are flattened together. Primordics reframes these not as dead ends but as diagnostic cues: opportunities to see where our abstractions are overextended. In this way, philosophy becomes less about chasing final answers and more about cultivating a flexible, self-correcting stance toward thought itself.
