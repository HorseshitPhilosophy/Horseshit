### Definition 0 — Appearance / Awareness (A)
**Awareness** = the simple fact that anything shows up at all.  
It isn’t a substance or a thing; it’s the **background condition** that makes any statement, observation, or theory possible.

### Axiom 1 — Occurrence
Every statement, theory, perception, or proof **happens within awareness** (A).  
There are no “free-floating” claims outside of what appears.

---

### Definition 1 — Token
A **token** is any repeatable mark, word, symbol, or gesture that carries meaning within a context.  
Tokens let a frame “say” things—like *true*, *false*, *mass*, *legal*, or *beautiful*.  
They can be sounds, written words, mathematical signs, or habitual gestures of thought.

### Definition 2 — Rule
A **rule** tells you how tokens can be combined, used, or tested.  
Rules define what counts as valid reasoning, evidence, or expression inside a frame.

### Definition 3 — Adjudicator
An **adjudicator** is whatever the frame treats as its final authority for deciding what’s acceptable.  
Examples: in science, experiment; in math, proof; in law, precedent; in everyday talk, shared understanding.  
The adjudicator sets the standard for correctness inside that frame.

### Definition 4 — Scope or Boundary
A **scope** (or **boundary**) marks what the frame covers—its topic and limits.  
Beyond that boundary, its tokens or rules may no longer apply or may shift meaning.

### Definition 5 — Authentication
**Authentication** is the process by which a frame decides how to treat an expression:  
approve it (accept/validate), reject it (invalidate), or suspend judgment (uncertain, undefined, open).  
It’s the frame’s way of applying its rules and adjudicator to a specific case.

### Definition 6 — Indication Frame (F)
A **frame** is the whole setup that includes:  
1. its **tokens**,  
2. its **rules**,  
3. its **adjudicator(s)**,  
4. its **scope/boundary**, and  
5. its process of **authentication**.  

It’s the local structure that gives meaning to statements and decides what counts as legitimate within that context.

### Axiom 2 — Frame Dependence
Every expression is **authenticated within some frame** F.  
Outside a frame, words and symbols don’t have a stable or agreed meaning.

### Definition 7 — Expression
An **expression** is anything said, written, or symbolized inside a frame’s language.  
It can be a sentence, equation, gesture, or statement—whatever the frame treats as something that can be checked or judged.

---

### Definition 8 — Adjudicator Token (t₍F₎)
Many frames have a special **token** that represents their adjudicator’s standard of judgment—like *true*, *provable*, *legal*, *beautiful*, or *heap*.  
This token belongs to the **level that evaluates** the frame’s expressions; it’s the label the frame uses to mark what passes its test.

---

### Axiom 3 — No Absolute Frame
No single frame can stand outside **all** others to judge them “from nowhere.”  
Every claim is made **within some frame**, and any attempt to talk across frames has to **say which frame it’s speaking from**.  
In other words: cross-frame statements must **index** their scope.

---

### Definition 9 — Indexing and Meta-frames (F′)
When you use an adjudicator token about expressions inside frame **F**, but do so **from a higher-level frame**, that move is called **indexing**.  
For example: saying “true-in-F” or “provable-in-F” inside another frame **F′**.  
Indexing keeps track of which level or context each judgment belongs to.

---

### Axiom 4 — Separation Requirement
To keep evaluations stable, a frame must **not reuse its own adjudicator token inside itself** unless it’s clearly re-indexed.  
The token that does the judging (*true*, *provable*, etc.) has to stay one level above what it judges.  
When that separation blurs, paradoxes appear.

---

### Lemma 1 — The Reference Constraint (talking about awareness)
When we talk **about awareness**, our words can only **point to** aspects of it that the listener can already recognize in some form.  
Language can’t *import* a completely new kind of experience into someone who’s never had anything like it—it can only **signal** or **remind** through shared structure.

*Reasoning:*  
By **Axiom 2 (Frame Dependence)**, meaning only exists inside a frame,  
and by **Axiom 1 (Occurrence)**, every frame is already inside awareness.  
So if the listener doesn’t have the experiential background that makes a word meaningful in their own frame, the “indexing” fails—communication won’t connect.

---

### Lemma 2 — No Transparent Self-Adjudication
If an expression inside a frame **F** tries to **use** that frame’s own adjudicator token (**t₍F₎**) **to judge itself** without moving to a higher frame, the result can’t settle.  
The evaluation either **stops immediately** (the frame refuses it as invalid) or **loops endlessly** (keeps flipping between outcomes).

*Reasoning:*  
This breaks **Axiom 4 (Separation Requirement)**—it erases the boundary between what judges and what’s being judged.  
Without that boundary, the frame can’t reach a stable verdict.

---

### Theorem 1 — Frame-Flattening Theorem (Paradox)
An **apparent paradox** happens exactly when a frame **reuses its own adjudicator token** inside itself **without moving up a level** or clearly marking the shift.  
In short: the frame tries to judge itself using its own rules.

**Repair options:**  
1. **Lift to F′ (a higher frame):** move the evaluation up a level so the adjudicator now sits outside what it’s judging.  
2. **Retokenize or ban the move:** change the grammar or vocabulary so that the expression is no longer treated as legitimate inside that frame.

*Reasoning:*  
By **Lemma 2**, self-judging expressions can’t stabilize.  
By **Axiom 4**, the problem is the collapse of levels—the frame and its adjudicator have merged.  
Either lifting or retokenizing restores the distinction, so the oscillation disappears.

---

**Corollary 1 — The Liar Case (plain)**  
“This sentence is false.”  
In the normal truth-based frame, this sentence uses the token *false* to judge itself.  
To fix it, we can either:  
- **Disqualify it:** say it’s not a proper statement at all (an **expression-level repair**), or  
- **Lift it:** say it’s **true-at-meta**, meaning it correctly points out a failure in the lower-level truth frame (a **frame-level repair**).  

Either way, the contradiction dissolves—there’s no genuine paradox left.

---

**Corollary 2 — The Sorites Case (the “heap” problem)**  
The word *heap* behaves as if one crisp rule applied to every case—one grain, two grains, ten thousand—when in fact the boundary keeps shifting with context.  
Flattening all those tiny context-frames into one “universal” rule causes the paradox.  

**Repair:**  
- **Index by context:** treat “heap” as relative to each situation (contextual or fuzzy logic), or  
- **Use dual tokens:** keep everyday *heap* for loose talk and define a technical *HEAP* for precise cases.  

Either fix restores the missing distinction between frames.

---

### Definition 10 — Viability
A belief, model, or practice is **viable** when it can hold together over time.  
More precisely, something is viable if it:
1. **stays stable** under small disturbances,  
2. **recovers** after being challenged or disrupted,  
3. **fits** smoothly with neighboring frames or viewpoints (it doesn’t create constant conflict), and  
4. **supports** further coherent development instead of blocking it.

### Axiom 5 — Viability Constraint
What lasts in thought or practice is what remains **viable** under real-world feedback.  
Ideas or systems that can’t adjust to pressure or contradiction either collapse or get pushed to the margins.

### Lemma 3 — Truth as Post-Repair Durability
Within a properly separated and indexed frame, “truth” means **lasting stability after repair**.  
A statement counts as true when—after we’ve fixed any level-mixing or language errors—it continues to hold up through contact, testing, and use.

*Reasoning:*  
By **Axiom 5**, endurance under feedback defines viability.  
By **Axiom 4**, evaluation only stabilizes when levels are kept distinct.  
Put together, “truth” is simply what stays coherent once the frame is in good working order.

### Theorem 2 — No “Absolute Metaphysics” from Inside a Frame
Any claim that tries to describe **ultimate reality** from *inside* a single language or worldview is doing a kind of **frame-flattening**.  
It uses one local set of rules to declare itself universal, erasing the difference between its own limits and reality itself.

On closer look, such claims always reduce to one of two things:
1. an **indexed program** — a framed, scoped project that clearly states its context and purpose, or  
2. a **collapse** — a self-referential paradox where the frame tries to judge itself as absolute.

*Reasoning:*  
From **Axiom 3 (No Absolute Frame)**, no system can fairly judge all systems “from nowhere.”  
And from **Theorem 1 (Frame-Flattening)**, trying to do so creates paradox.  
Only by **indexing**—openly marking the frame’s limits—can we rescue a system as a **program or design**, not as a universal doctrine.

---

**Corollary 3 — Why Starting from Awareness Isn’t Metaphysics**
By **Axiom 1**, every frame already happens within awareness.  
By **Theorem 2**, any attempt to justify or explain awareness “from outside” awareness contradicts itself.  
So starting from awareness isn’t a metaphysical claim about some cosmic substance—it’s simply **good bookkeeping** about where all speaking and knowing take place.

---

### Definition 11 — Tokens (private / shared / system)
**Tokens** are repeatable cues that help rebuild or pass on stable meanings.  
They range from **private habits** (a personal association or image), to **shared words** in conversation, to **formal symbols** in logical or technical systems.  
Tokens are the building blocks that let stabilizations—beliefs, ideas, or models—be repeated and communicated.

---

### Lemma 4 — Drift
As tokens move between people, cultures, or systems, their meanings **shift**—a process called **semantic drift**.  
Successful systems don’t fight this drift; they **track it**, adjusting their language by re-defining terms, adding context markers (indexing), or updating rules of use.  
Denial of drift leads to confusion; awareness of it keeps meaning viable.

---

### Theorem 3 — Communication Success Criterion
Communication works when people share **enough of a frame** to rebuild the same stabilization.  
If meaning fails to transfer, it usually points to a **frame mismatch**—different assumptions, rules, or adjudicators—not to bad faith or nonsense.  
Understanding happens when overlapping frames provide enough common structure to re-instantiate what the speaker intended.

---

### Theorem 4 — Conceptual Homeostasis
Within awareness, the stability of meaning depends on **continuous adjustment**.  
Frames must keep realigning to stay coherent under new information and feedback.  
Because philosophy studies meaning and structure themselves, its core function is to **maintain viable conceptual balance**—a state of **conceptual homeostasis**.

*Reasoning:*  
From **Axiom 5 (Viability)** and **Lemma 3 (Truth as Durability)**, stability means coherence that can survive feedback.  
From **Theorem 1 (Frame-Flattening)**, breakdown happens when distinctions blur; repair restores equilibrium.  
Therefore, lasting understanding is not built on fixed foundations but on ongoing self-correction and readjustment.

---

**Corollary — The Task of Philosophy**  
Philosophy’s job isn’t to discover unchanging truths, but to keep the network of meanings **alive and functional**—  
to notice where coherence breaks down and to restore balance with the least possible distortion.

---

### Theorem 5 — The Pseudo-Problem Principle
Most long-standing philosophical “problems” arise from **frame-flattening**—from mixing together rules or standards that belong to **different frames**.  
In other words, a problem becomes “unsolvable” when one frame’s way of judging things is **reused** inside another as if the two shared the same basis of evaluation.

Formally:  
If an expression **E₁**, valid within frame **F₁**, is used to judge an expression **E₂** inside frame **F₂** as though **F₁** and **F₂** had the same adjudicator, contradiction or stalemate follows.  
Once the frames are separated again—each with its own standards and scope—the contradiction disappears.

---

**Corollary — Philosophy as Diagnosis**  
Philosophy’s job is not to solve these pseudo-problems by inventing new theories inside a collapsed frame,  
but to **diagnose where the collapse happened**—to restore the missing distinctions between frames.  
Philosophy doesn’t tell reality what it must be; it **shows language where it has overstepped its reach**.

---

**Examples**

- **Mind–body dualism:** The “mental” and the “physical” are not rival substances; they are different **frames of stabilization** that describe the same events at different levels.  
- **The Is–Ought problem:** You can’t derive moral norms from descriptive facts because *ought* and *is* belong to **distinct adjudicative frames**.  
- **Skepticism:** Demanding proof of knowledge “from outside knowledge” repeats the same flattening—it asks one frame to validate itself from nowhere.

---

In short:  
What philosophy calls a “problem” is often a **signal of overlap or confusion between frames**.  
Its real work is to notice these confusions and **re-differentiate** the levels of sense, keeping the system of meanings coherent and alive.
