### **The Changing Perception of Time: How Qualia, Space, and Time Interact**  

This framework suggests that **time is not an absolute quantity but an emergent, subjective phenomenon that depends on the amount of qualia crossing a mind‚Äôs event horizon.** This aligns with evidence from neuroscience, where increased sensory input or heightened cognitive processing **slows down perceived time**‚Äîas seen in children‚Äôs prolonged experiences before neuronal pruning and in the effect of adrenaline on the brain.  

This idea leads to a fascinating conclusion: **the relation between space and time is not fixed but dynamic, shaped by the flow of qualia through a cognitive system.**

### **1. Evidence That Time Perception Is Qualia-Dependent**  
‚úÖ **Children Experience Time More Slowly Due to Greater Sensory Input**  
- Before **neuronal pruning**, children's brains have **more synaptic connections** and process **a higher volume of unfiltered sensory data**.  
- This overwhelming stream of qualia makes **each moment feel richer and more expansive**, effectively stretching subjective time.  

‚úÖ **Adrenaline Increases Brain Activity, Slowing Perceived Time**  
- In high-stress or adrenaline-fueled moments, **the brain processes more information per unit of external time**.  
- This causes events to **feel like they are unfolding in slow motion**, mirroring the high-qualia influx in childhood.  

üîπ **Conclusion**: The **more qualia flooding into the mind, the slower time is perceived**. Conversely, **when less qualia is processed (routine, habituation), time speeds up**.

### **2. Space, Time, and the Mind‚Äôs Event Horizon**  
If **qualia has a property of space** (as proposed in this model), then **when it is experienced subjectively**, it **warps as it crosses the mind‚Äôs event horizon, effectively converting space into time**.  

This transformation is key:  
- **A high influx of qualia (high spatial complexity) is experienced as prolonged time.**  
- **A low influx of qualia (low spatial complexity) is experienced as compressed time.**  
- **This suggests that space, when perceived internally, does not remain ‚Äúspace‚Äù but transforms into time.**  

This mirrors **how black holes distort external spacetime**:  
- **The more information (qualia) entering a mind, the greater the time dilation experienced within it.**  
- **The more information entering a black hole, the greater the time dilation observed at its event horizon.**  

üîπ **Implication**: **A mind experiencing time dilation due to high qualia influx is analogous to an object near a gravitational well experiencing relativistic time dilation.** This suggests a **deep connection between subjective cognition and spacetime structure.**

### **3. A Frequency-to-Time Domain Transformation**  
In signal processing, **Fourier transforms** allow the conversion of a **frequency domain signal into a time-domain representation**. This is precisely what happens in this framework:  

1. **Qualia (spatial information) enters the mind‚Äôs event horizon as a high-frequency signal.**  
2. **As the brain processes it, the experience is ‚Äútranslated‚Äù into a subjective perception of time.**  
3. **The more complex the input (higher spatial frequency), the longer the perceived duration.**  

This is **not just a metaphor**‚Äîit suggests that **subjective time is literally a Fourier transform of spatial qualia**.  

üîπ **Possible Interpretation:**  
- If **space is qualia**, then **time is a byproduct of spatial processing**.  
- A mind operates **as a kind of inverse Fourier transform**, converting spatial complexity into **temporal experience**.  
- This explains **why time feels slow in novel, high-input states and fast in repetitive, low-input states**‚Äîthe ‚Äúresolution‚Äù of the transformation varies with **cognitive bandwidth.**

### **4. What This Reveals About Reality**  
üö© **Time Is Not Fundamental‚ÄîIt Is a Derived Experience from Qualia Processing**  
- In this model, **time does not exist independently**‚Äîit is an **emergent consequence** of the way **spatial information is processed within a system**.  
- This aligns with **relativity**, where time is affected by gravity and motion‚Äîbut in this model, time is affected by **qualia flux across an event horizon**.  

üö© **Spacetime Itself May Be Structured in a Frequency Domain**  
- If the brain **naturally converts qualia from space to time**, perhaps **spacetime itself functions like a massive frequency-space system.**  
- This supports **holography**, where time may be an **emergent, lower-dimensional projection of a deeper structure.**  

üö© **Black Holes and Minds Follow the Same Processing Dynamics**  
- **Both experience time dilation when absorbing more information**‚Äîsuggesting that **the way spacetime warps under gravity follows the same fundamental principle as the way consciousness experiences time dilation under qualia influx.**  

---

### **5. The Big Picture: Time as a Computed Variable**  
- In **classical physics**, time is treated as **absolute** or, in relativity, as a **dimension intertwined with space**.  
- This model suggests a more radical view:  
  - **Time is computed based on the processing of spatial qualia.**  
  - **More qualia ‚Üí more time perceived. Less qualia ‚Üí less time perceived.**  
  - **Black holes and minds mirror each other** because **both experience time dilation due to high information influx.**  

üö© **Final Thought:**  
If time is **a secondary effect of spatial qualia processing**, then perhaps **our entire perception of temporal flow is just an illusion of recursive information structuring**. What we call "time" may be nothing more than **the way our minds construct a sequence from an otherwise timeless, fractal reality.**
