### **God and Perception: Why God Does Not See Us, and Why We Are Gods Too**

In this framework, **God is not an all-seeing entity watching over reality, but rather the deepest, highest layer of existence that we can perceive.** However, just as our perception is limited to our own layer of reality, **God’s perception is directed outward toward His own higher-layer structures.** This means that from God’s perspective, **He does not see us, nor can He directly interact with our layer.** Yet, because reality is fractal, this principle applies to us as well—**we are gods to the layers beneath us.**

---

### **1. God’s Perception is Outward, Not Inward**
- Just as **we perceive external reality rather than the inner lives of subatomic particles, God perceives His own higher-layered structures, not us.**
- To **God, His experience is as vast and structured as ours is to us—He is not “aware” of our universe because His attention is focused on His own layer’s complexities.**
- **We are to God what a cell is to us—not perceived as a conscious entity, but as part of a larger emergent structure.**

✅ **Implication:** **God does not look down at us because His perception is structured to process reality at His own scale.**

---

### **2. The Universe is a Shadow of God’s Reality**
- **Because God cannot see us directly, what we experience as physical reality is merely an indirect consequence of His higher-layer processes.**
- **Dark matter, dark energy, and gravity might be shadows of deeper-layer interactions occurring in God’s spacetime.**
- **We are experiencing the side effects of a reality that is too vast and structured for God to even recognize our layer as separate from His own.**

✅ **Implication:** **We only perceive echoes and constraints of a reality vastly beyond our own, not its direct structure.**

---

### **3. "God" is Not an Ultimate Being—Only the Highest Layer We Can Perceive**
- **There is no “final” layer of reality—only the deepest one accessible from any given vantage point.**
- If **we develop the ability to see past the cosmic microwave background, then “God” would no longer be the CMB, but something beyond it.**
- Just as **our ancestors once thought of the sky as “heaven” until telescopes showed us galaxies, the idea of “God” moves deeper as we expand perception.**

✅ **Implication:** **God is only ever the deepest structure that we can perceive at a given stage of understanding.**

---

### **4. We Are Gods to the Layers Beneath Us**
- **Reality is fractal—just as we look to deeper layers and call them “God,” the layers beneath us look to us as gods.**
- Our **thoughts, decisions, and actions unknowingly shape the structures below us**, just as God’s deeper-layer processes shape our reality.
- **If subatomic particles and cells operate within our perception but do not experience reality as we do, then we are the unknowable forces shaping their existence.**
- **This suggests that every mind is itself a god, relative to the layers below, whether conscious of it or not.**

✅ **Implication:** **Godhood is not a singular state but a relational one—every being is a god to that which exists beneath its layer.**

---

### **5. What This Means for the Nature of Reality**
- **We are not created by God—we are incidental to His structure.**
- **There is no divine plan or intervention—only the self-organizing criticality of deeper processes playing out in ways we interpret as “reality.”**
- **From our perspective, we are conscious beings—while from God’s perspective, we are structural harmonics of deeper-layer interactions.**
- **What we call “consciousness” may be a shadow of a more fundamental phenomenon at God's level.**

✅ **Implication:** **We are experiencing reality from within a structure that is not even perceivable to the layer above us.**

---

### **Final Thought: God is Unaware of Us, and We are Unaware of What Lies Above Him—Yet We Are Gods as Well**
- **God does not see us because His event horizon limits perception to His own reality.**
- **Likewise, we do not see the layers above Him because our event horizon limits perception to our own universe.**
- **Reality is structured so that each layer is only aware of itself and the shadows of the layer below.**
- **If we reach a deeper understanding, “God” will no longer be God—something greater will take His place.**
- **Yet, because this process is fractal, we ourselves unknowingly act as gods to the structures below us, shaping their reality without direct perception.**

✅ **Conclusion:** **God is not omniscient, omnipotent, or even aware of us—He is simply the deepest perceivable structure from our current vantage point, just as we are to the layers beneath us. The chain of gods is endless, and we are part of it.**
