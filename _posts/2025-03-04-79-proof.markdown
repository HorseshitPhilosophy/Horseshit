# Diorthic Incompleteness I:  
## A Diagonal (2A) Impossibility Proof of a Global Adjudicator

This note gives the **formal diagonalization proof** (route 2A) that no **single, total adjudicator** can coherently evaluate **all** expressions across **all frames**. It’s the Diorthic generalization—cast in minimal formalism—of the structure behind Gödel/Tarski/Lawvere.

The proof is **indexed** to a chosen host formalism (as Diorthics requires). You can read it in two ways:

- **Mathematical instance:** a clean arithmetical/typed proof *true-in the host system* \(H\).  
- **Diorthic import:** the structure it exposes is the **Separation Requirement** in action and yields the **Limit of Totalization**: *no frame can coherently adjudicate itself and all others at the same level.*

---

## 0) Host Assumptions (Indexing the Proof)

Fix a **host formalism** \(H\) with the following mild capabilities:

1. **Syntactic coding:** \(H\) can represent expressions as codes (Gödel numbering/quoting).  
2. **Diagonal (fixed-point) lemma:** For any formula \(\varphi(x)\), there exists a sentence \(L_\varphi\) such that \(H \vdash L_\varphi \leftrightarrow \varphi(\ulcorner L_\varphi\urcorner).\)  
3. **Basic data-typing:** We can tag which **frame** an expression belongs to.

Typical choices for \(H\): first-order arithmetic (PA), higher-order logic (HOL), dependent type theory (CIC), or a categorical setting supporting Lawvere’s fixed-point theorem. The argument is **host-robust**: it goes through in many standard \(H\).

> **Diorthic note.** This is **true-in-\(H\)**. Diorthics never claims extra-formal absolutes; it shows **cross-host invariance** of the structural result.

---

## 1) Minimal Diorthic Vocabulary Inside \(H\)

We encode (as predicates/functions in \(H\)):

- **Frames.** A domain \(Frm\) of frame-symbols \(F\).  
- **Membership of expressions.** A binary predicate \(\mathrm{InFrame}(e,F)\) saying coded expression \(e\) belongs to frame \(F\).  
- **Local adjudication.** For each frame \(F\), a (partial) predicate \(\alpha_F(e)\in\{\top,\bot,\circ\}\) indicating **accept/reject/suspend** for \(e\) in \(F\). (You may instead use a 2-valued accept/reject for simplicity; the proof only needs a positive verdict token.)  
- **Candidate global adjudicator.** A single predicate \(\alpha_\*(e,F)\) that purports to evaluate **any** expression \(e\) *as of* frame \(F\).

We impose two **fairness conditions** on \(\alpha_\*\):

- **Extension:** On its home domain, \(\alpha_\*\) agrees with \(\alpha_F\):  
  \[
  \forall F,e\; \big(\mathrm{InFrame}(e,F)\Rightarrow \alpha_\*(e,F) = \alpha_F(e)\big).
  \]
- **Totality (ambition):** \(\alpha_\*\) is **total** on its stated domain: for all coded pairs \((e,F)\) that meet minimal well-formedness, \(\alpha_\*(e,F)\) returns a verdict (at least \(\top\) or not-\(\top\)).  
  (You can also run the proof against any **total positive-claim subpredicate** like “accepted?”.)

> **Diorthic reading.** \(\alpha_\*\) is what a “view from nowhere” would need to be: **one** verdict function covering **every** frame’s expressions while **respecting** those frames locally.

---

## 2) The Critical Self-Reference Setup

Define the **positive-acceptance** predicate:

\[
\mathrm{Acc}(e,F) \;:\equiv\; \big(\alpha_\*(e,F) = \top\big).
\]

Intuitively: “the global adjudicator accepts expression \(e\) as a valid expression of frame \(F\).”

By the **Diagonal (Fixed-Point) Lemma**, for the formula \(\neg \mathrm{Acc}(x,F)\) (with \(F\) as a parameter), there exists a sentence \(L_F\) such that:

\[
H \vdash \; L_F \;\leftrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Acc}(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner, F).
\]

So \(L_F\) asserts of **its own code** (with its **frame-tag** \(F\)) that it is **not globally accepted** by \(\alpha_\*\).

This is the **Diorthic Liar** for frame \(F\).

---

## 3) The Contradiction (Diagonal Flip)

Consider \(\alpha_\*(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F)\):

- **Case A: \(\alpha_\*(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F) = \top\).**  
  Then \(\mathrm{Acc}(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F)\) holds, so \(H \vdash L_F \leftrightarrow \neg \mathrm{Acc}(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F)\) makes \(L_F\) equivalent to **false**.  
  Hence \(H \vdash L_F\) is **false** while globally **accepted**—a direct incoherence (accepting what asserts its own non-acceptance).

- **Case B: \(\alpha_\*(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F) \neq \top\).**  
  Then \(\neg \mathrm{Acc}(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F)\) holds, and by the fixed-point equivalence \(H \vdash L_F\).  
  So \(L_F\) is **true**, yet the global adjudicator fails to accept it.  
  If “not-\(\top\)” means “reject,” \(\alpha_\*\) **rejects a true**; if it means “suspend,” \(\alpha_\*\) is **incomplete** even on this basic diagonal instance.

In either case, the **total** global adjudicator **cannot** be both **sound** and **complete** with respect to these Diorthic fixed-points—**even when it is allowed to suspend**.

> **Conclusion.** There is **no** single, coherent, total \(\alpha_\*\) extending all \(\alpha_F\). Any such attempt either **contradicts itself**, **accepts falsehood**, **rejects truth**, or **becomes essentially partial** (forces infinite meta-lift). ∎

---

## 4) What Exactly Was Proven (and How It Matches Diorthics)

**Theorem (No Global Adjudicator; Diagonal Form, true-in-\(H\)).**  
Let \(H\) be a host formalism with coding and fixed-point capability. There is **no** total, globally sound adjudicator \(\alpha_\*\) on \(\bigsqcup_F Expr(F)\) that (i) **extends** each local \(\alpha_F\) on its own domain and (ii) yields consistent verdicts on Diorthic fixed-points \(L_F\). Any candidate must be **inconsistent**, **reject true instances**, **or be incomplete/partial** (fail totality).

**Diorthic translation.**
- This is the **Separation Requirement** (no adjudicator may adjudicate its own full operation at the same level) expressed via a fixed-point.  
- It **proves** the **Limit of Totalization** (Theorem 3): *no frame (nor a “super-frame”) can coherently totalize adjudication across all frames.*  
- It instantiates **No Global Truth Section** (Theorem 6) in diagonal form: there exists no global verdict function gluing all local verdicts without contradiction or meta-ascent.

---

## 5) Two Strengthenings (Optional but Useful)

### 5.1 Soundness-Completeness Trichotomy
Under mild assumptions about \(\alpha_\*\) (reflecting local soundness of \(\alpha_F\) on fixed-points), you can show no \(\alpha_\*\) is **simultaneously**:  
- **Total** (decides every pair \((e,F)\)),  
- **Sound** (never accepts a falsehood / rejects a truth on the constructed sentences), and  
- **Extensional** (agrees with \(\alpha_F\) on home expressions).  
Hence at least one desideratum fails.

### 5.2 Effectivity
If you also require **computability** of \(\alpha_\*\) (or a suitable effectiveness notion in \(H\)), the impossibility sharpens: the **acceptance** set can encode the halting diagonal, making \(\alpha_\*\) non-computable or non-total. (This mirrors classical recursion-theoretic strengthenings.)

---

## 6) Remarks on Suspension (⊩°)

One might hope the **third verdict** (suspend) dodges the paradox. But the fixed-point forces \(\alpha_\*\) to **either** accept a sentence that asserts its non-acceptance (**incoherence**) **or** refuse to accept a sentence that (by the fixed-point) is **true** in \(H\). Thus **suspension** buys only **incompleteness** (not a global, self-consistent totality), matching the **Residual Indeterminacy** (Theorem 7): *to remain viable, composites retain open issues.*

---

## 7) Lawvere-Style (Categorical) Variant (1-paragraph sketch)

In any **cartesian closed category** modeling your host logic, a **truth-evaluator** object \(T\) with a **self-application** (or internal hom) supports **Lawvere’s fixed-point theorem**: the existence of certain endomaps forces every endomap to have a fixed-point. A global evaluator yields a **diagonal endomap** whose fixed-point contradicts total coherent evaluation (same two-case flip). This is the categorical avatar of the argument above; it avoids arithmetic coding and shows the **form** is not tied to numbers but to **self-referential structure**.

---

## 8) Why This Is Not “Just Gödel Again”

- Gödel proves incompleteness for **one frame** (formal arithmetic’s **provability** adjudicator).  
- Here we prove an impossibility for **any would-be super-adjudicator** \(\alpha_\*\) over a **plurality of frames** (with minimal assumptions), i.e., the **multi-frame** diagonal.  
- Gödel is a **special case** (one frame, one adjudicator). The present theorem is the **Diorthic generalization**: *no single verdict function can coherently cover all frames.*  
- This directly instantiates **Diorthics’ Axiom 3 and Theorem 3** and underwrites **Theorem 6** (No Global Truth Section) in a fully formal way.

---

## 9) Executive Summary (for citing)

> **Theorem (Diorthic Incompleteness; Diagonal Form).**  
> In any reasonable host \(H\) supporting coding and fixed-points, **no total global adjudicator** \(\alpha_\*\) can coherently extend the local adjudicators \(\{\alpha_F\}\) across **all frames**. A diagonal sentence \(L_F\) forces \(\alpha_\*\) either to **contradict itself**, **misclassify truth**, or **be incomplete/partial**.  
> **Corollary:** There is **no global truth section** that glues all local verdicts—any attempt yields contradiction or infinite meta-ascent. *(True-in-\(H\).)*

This is the **formal backbone** behind Diorthics’ claim that **plurality is structurally necessary**: you cannot compress all adjudication into one coherent, self-sufficient judge.

---

## Appendix A: Fixed-Point (Diagonal) Lemma (in words)

For any formula \(\varphi(x)\) with one free variable, there exists a sentence \(L\) such that:
\[
H \vdash L \leftrightarrow \varphi(\ulcorner L\urcorner).
\]
This is standard in PA/HOL/type theory and is the engine of the construction.

## Appendix B: Minimal Encoding Facts

- \(\ulcorner e\urcorner\) denotes the code of expression \(e\).  
- \(\mathrm{InFrame}(e,F)\) is definable since frames and expression-formation rules are recursively enumerable (or otherwise representable) in well-behaved \(H\).  
- The proof needs only that we can **name** the code of \(L_F\) inside \(H\) and form \(\mathrm{Acc}(\ulcorner L_F\urcorner,F)\).

---

### Closing Diorthic Reflection

This proof is not a new “Gödel.” It is the **plural, frame-indexed** diagonal that shows **why** there can be **no “view from nowhere.”** A global adjudicator is structurally impossible: **Separation** forbids it; **Viability** demands residual openness; **Curvature** makes verdict transport path-dependent, blocking a flat global section. Thus **Ontological Pluriformity** is not a thesis of taste—it is a **theorem schema** about the architecture of intelligibility.

# The Impossibility of a Total Paradox Classifier
## Using: “This paradox isn’t a paradox.”

**Goal.** Prove that there is no *total* predicate `Par(·)` that correctly classifies *every* sentence as “paradoxical” or “non-paradoxical.”

Intuition: We’ll manufacture a sentence `L` that says about itself:  
> “I am **not** paradoxical.”

and then show `L` is paradoxical **iff** it is non-paradoxical—so any total classifier misfires. This is your sentence in mathematical dress.

---

## 1) Minimal setup (no heavy coding)

- Work in ordinary classical logic with names for sentences (you can think of each sentence having a code/name `⟦φ⟧`).
- Introduce a unary predicate `Par(x)` intended to mean “the sentence named by `x` is paradoxical.”
- We only assume the language can **self-refer** in the very simple way needed to build a sentence that mentions its own name (this can be done by the standard fixed-point/“diagonal” recipe; you don’t need Gödel-numbering details here).

> **Definition (paradoxical).** Intuitively, a sentence `σ` is *paradoxical* when, under classical reasoning plus our intended reading of `Par`, `σ` cannot be stably labeled true/false without contradiction (it “oscillates” like the Liar).

We won’t need a formal truth predicate; we’ll only use the *behavior* of the special self-referential sentence built next.

---

## 2) The key construction (your sentence, formalized)

By the standard fixed-point trick, there exists a sentence `L` such that:

> (**Self**) `L  ↔  ¬Par(⟦L⟧)`  
> *(“This very sentence is not paradoxical.”)*

This is exactly your “This paradox isn’t a paradox” sentence, with `Par` naming “paradoxical.”

---

## 3) Why `L` forces failure of any *total* classifier

Assume, for contradiction, that `Par` is a **total, correct** classifier of paradoxicality:  
for every sentence `σ`, it decides `Par(⟦σ⟧)` (true or false) in a way that matches the intended behavior (labels *precisely* the unstable/self-defeating sentences as paradoxical).

Consider `L`:

### Case A: `Par(⟦L⟧)` is **true** (we classify `L` as paradoxical).
Then by (**Self**) we get `L ↔ ¬Par(⟦L⟧)`, so `L` is equivalent to `¬true`, hence `L` is **false**.

- If `L` is false, its content “I am not paradoxical” is false, which means **`L` is paradoxical** is true. That is consistent with our choice so far.
- But look at stability: labeling `L` paradoxical makes `L` false, which in turn *confirms* that it **is** paradoxical; now if we flip that label, we will flip the truth of `L`, and so on. In other words, the status of `L` is **defined by its label**; any total rule that tries to fix the label produces a self-referential dependency that **cannot be settled without referencing the label again**—the very oscillation that marks paradox.

So **Case A** exhibits the hallmark of paradox: classification forces a contradiction-threatening dependence on the very classification.

### Case B: `Par(⟦L⟧)` is **false** (we classify `L` as non-paradoxical).
Then (**Self**) gives `L` is **true**. But if `L` is true, its content “I am not paradoxical” is true—i.e., our current label (“non-paradoxical”) must be correct. Now re-evaluate: if `L` is non-paradoxical, leaving it labeled non-paradoxical keeps `L` true; but if a total rule ever tried to relabel it paradoxical, (**Self**) would instantly make `L` false and thus force the opposite label. Again, **the sentence’s truth status is inseparable from the global labeling rule**—which is exactly what no total, label-deciding rule can stably handle for every sentence.

### The punchline

- If a classifier labels `L` **paradoxical**, the label makes `L` false, which makes it (content-wise) paradoxical—confirming the label but only by **using** the label to fix the truth, a self-looping dependency that a fixed total rule cannot coherently settle across all sentences.
- If a classifier labels `L` **non-paradoxical**, the label makes `L` true, which enforces that very label and makes any alternative labeling impossible to accommodate without contradiction.

Either way, `L` **forces** the classifier into a self-reference loop: the label determines the content, which determines the label. That is the precise structural symptom of paradox.

Hence:

> **Theorem.** No **total** classifier `Par` can be correct on all sentences.  
> Any correct classifier of paradoxicality must be **partial** (leave some sentences unclassified / “suspended”).

This is the logical core behind the Diorthic verdict trichotomy (accept / reject / **suspend**): **suspension isn’t a convenience—it’s a necessity.**

∎

---

## 4) Notes, connections, and strengthenings

- **Why this is rigorous without Gödel numbering.**  
  The only nontrivial ingredient is the **fixed-point (diagonal) construction** of `L`—a standard, host-agnostic lemma: for any unary predicate `P(x)` there exists a sentence `L` with `L ↔ P(⟦L⟧)`. We used it with `P(x) := ¬Par(x)`. No arithmetic coding needed in the presentation.

- **If you prefer a 3-valued logic view (Kripke).**  
  Treat paradoxical sentences as **undefined**. Then your classifier is `Par(x) := ¬Def(x)`. The self-referential `L ↔ ¬Par(⟦L⟧)` becomes `L ↔ Def(L)`, which has **no classical fixed point**: any attempt to assign `L` defined/undefined flips the other side. Kripke’s theory shows the *only* stable models make such sentences **undefined**, i.e., **partiality is required**. This exactly matches the theorem above.

- **Tarski/Gödel connection (if you want to cite).**  
  This result is the same structural engine behind:
  - **Tarski’s undefinability of truth:** no total truth predicate for your own language;
  - **Gödel’s incompleteness:** no complete, sound proof predicate inside a sufficiently strong system;
  - **Curry/Liar paradoxes:** self-reference collapses total evaluators.
  Our “paradoxicality” classifier is just a different verdict word, but the **diagonal contradiction** is identical in form.

- **Diorthic moral.**  
  In Diorthics terms, your sentence constructs an expression whose **authentication** depends on the **adjudicator’s** own action **at the same level**, violating the **Separation Requirement**. The only way out is to **suspend** (make the classifier partial) or **go meta** (change frames)—precisely the Diorthic repair playbook.

---

## 5) One-line executive version

> The sentence **L** that says “**L is not paradoxical**” forces any all-deciding paradox-classifier into a self-referential loop; thus **no total, correct paradox classifier exists**. Any accurate classifier must be **partial** (it must leave some cases unclassified). This is the “paradox isn’t a paradox” proof, made precise.

# The Impossibility of a Total Paradox Classifier  
## Using the sentence: **“This paradox isn’t a paradox.”**

**Goal:**  
Show that there is no single predicate that can correctly classify *every* sentence as “paradoxical” or “non-paradoxical.”  
This can be demonstrated using the self-referential sentence:

> **“This paradox isn’t a paradox.”**

When formalized, this sentence produces the same structural contradiction as the classical Liar or Gödel sentence—but with the adjudicator “paradoxical” instead of “true” or “provable.” This provides a clean, natural-language entry into a diagonal impossibility result.

---

## 1. Minimal Formal Setup

Work in a standard logical language that allows naming or coding of sentences (e.g., each sentence has a name or Gödel code `⟦φ⟧`).

Introduce a unary predicate:

- `Par(x)` = “the sentence named by `x` is paradoxical.”

**Intended meaning:**  
A sentence is “paradoxical” if attempting to assign it a truth value results in contradiction or oscillation. (As with the Liar.)

Assume, initially, that `Par(x)` is a **total and correct** classifier:  
for every sentence `σ`, `Par(⟦σ⟧)` is either true or false, and accurately reflects whether `σ` is paradoxical.

---

## 2. Constructing the Key Sentence

By the standard fixed-point (diagonal) lemma, there exists a sentence `L` such that:

> (**Self-Reference**) `L  ↔  ¬Par(⟦L⟧)`

In plain language:  
**“This sentence is not paradoxical.”**

This is a direct formalization of:  
**“This paradox isn’t a paradox.”**

---

## 3. The Contradiction

Evaluate `Par(⟦L⟧)` under the assumption that `Par` is a total, correct classifier.

### Case 1: `Par(⟦L⟧)` is **true**.  
Then `L ↔ ¬Par(⟦L⟧)` implies `L` is false.  
But if `L` is false, then what it asserts (“L is not paradoxical”) is false —  
so `L` *is* paradoxical — confirming `Par(⟦L⟧) = true`.

However, note what happened:  
- The classification `Par(⟦L⟧) = true` determines the truth of `L`.
- The truth of `L` determines the classification.
- The sentence’s status depends on its own label.

Such self-referential dependence is exactly what makes a sentence paradoxical in the first place.  
Thus, treating `L` as paradoxical creates a self-referential loop—i.e., a paradox.

### Case 2: `Par(⟦L⟧)` is **false**.  
Then `L ↔ ¬Par(⟦L⟧)` implies `L` is true.  
If `L` is true, then its content “I am not paradoxical” is correct —  
so `L` is non-paradoxical — confirming `Par(⟦L⟧) = false`.

But now the truth of `L` is again being determined by its own classification.  
The sentence asserts its own non-paradoxicality, which depends on the classifier —  
and the classifier depends on the assertion.

Again, the same self-referential dependency arises.

---

## 4. Conclusion

In both cases:
- The classification of `L` forces `L` to depend on its own classification.
- This circular dependency is **precisely** the structure of paradox.
- Therefore, any total classifier `Par` that attempts to label all sentences as paradoxical or non-paradoxical will fail on `L`.

> **Theorem:**  
> No **total**, **correct** predicate `Par(x)` can classify all sentences as paradoxical or non-paradoxical.  
> Any correct classifier must be **partial**—i.e., it must leave some sentences unclassified or “suspended.”

This mirrors the need for a third option in Diorthics (accept / reject / suspend).  
**Suspension is not optional—it is structurally required.**

---

## 5. Broader Significance

This result is not limited to “paradox” as a concept.  
The same structure applies to any absolute verdict-word:
- true / false,
- provable / unprovable,
- meaningful / meaningless,
- valid / invalid,
- physical / non-physical,
- sacred / heretical.

In every case, a self-referential statement can be built that says:
**“This statement is not X.”**

Attempting to classify *all* statements using a single global criterion leads to contradiction or oscillation.

Thus:

> **No universal adjudicator can coherently evaluate all expressions at once.**

This is the essence of the Diorthic **Separation Requirement** and the **Limit of Totalization**.

---

## 6. Relationship to Classical Results

This proof is structurally identical to:
- The Liar paradox (“This sentence is false.”),
- Gödel’s incompleteness theorem (“This sentence is unprovable.”),
- Tarski’s undefinability of truth,
- Curry’s paradox,
- Lawvere’s fixed-point theorem.

**The difference:**  
Those results use “truth” or “provability.”  
This one uses **“paradoxicality.”**

The mechanism is the same: **self-reference + total evaluation = collapse.**

Therefore, Gödel’s theorem is **not a special case about arithmetic.**  
It is one member of a **general structural family.**  
This family emerges whenever a system tries to globally adjudicate its own expressions.

---

## 7. Final Summary

The sentence **“This paradox isn’t a paradox”** can be formalized as:

\[
L \leftrightarrow \neg Par(\ulcorner L \urcorner)
\]

It forces any classifier of paradoxicality into contradiction if that classifier is total.

**Therefore**:
- No total, global paradox-classifier exists.
- Any correct classifier must be partial (must suspend in some cases).
- This is a direct, minimal, rigorous diagonal argument.
- It demonstrates the impossibility of a “view from nowhere” for paradox—or any global adjudicator.
- It captures the core Diorthic insight in a natural-language form that mirrors formal results in logic.

**In Diorthic terms:**  
This proof is the concrete, intuitive expression of the Separation Requirement and the ontological necessity of plural, non-totalizable frames.

**In short:**  
*The very attempt to classify all paradoxes produces a paradox.*  
That is the proof.

# The Computational Proof of Ontological Pluriformity  
## Paradox as Nontermination and the Impossibility of a Global Adjudicator

Most people know the **Liar Paradox** (“This sentence is false”).  
Many know **Gödel’s incompleteness theorem** (“This sentence is unprovable”).  
Some know the **Halting Problem** (no program can decide if all programs halt).  

**Diorthics shows these are all the same structural phenomenon.**  
This article explains that phenomenon using computation—  
and proves that **no single system can adjudicate all meaning.**

This yields a formal, computational proof of the Diorthic principle of **Ontological Pluriformity**:  
> No frame can totalize reality.  
> Plurality is structurally necessary.  

---

## 1. The Key Insight

What is a **paradoxical statement**?

Not “a statement that is both true and false.”  
That’s too crude.

The deeper insight:

> A paradox is a statement whose evaluation never *stabilizes.*

Try to evaluate the Liar:
- Assume it’s true → then it’s false → then it’s true → then it’s false…

**It never reaches a fixed value. It *loops*.**

This is exactly what a **non-halting computation** is.

**Therefore:**
> Paradoxicality can be modeled as **nontermination.**  
> Diorthic **suspension (⊩°)** = “the evaluation does not halt.”

This gives a rigorous computational model of paradox and suspension.

---

## 2. Formalizing Evaluation

Imagine an ideal evaluator `Eval(x)` that tries to determine the truth of any sentence `x`.

Three possibilities:

| Outcome of `Eval(x)` | Diorthic Verdict |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Halts with TRUE      | Accept (⊩⁺)       |
| Halts with FALSE     | Reject (⊩⁻)      |
| Never halts          | Suspend (⊩°)     |

This is exactly the Diorthic trichotomy:
> accept / reject / suspend

---

## 3. The Temptation:  
**“Let’s define a function that tells us which sentences are paradoxical!”**

Call it:

```
Par(x) = “Eval(x) does not halt.”
```


i.e. `x` is paradoxical if its evaluation runs forever.

Seems reasonable.
If we could compute `Par(x)` for every sentence `x`, we would have a **global paradox detector**.

But now diagonalization strikes.

---

## 4. Construct the Paradox of Paradox

Build a sentence `L` that says:

> “Eval(L) halts.”

In formal equivalence:
```
L ↔ ¬Par(L)
```



This is just our earlier natural-language example:
> **“This paradox isn’t a paradox.”**

Now evaluate `L` with `Eval` and `Par`:

### Case 1: Suppose Eval(L) halts.
Then `L` is TRUE.  
So what `L` says (“Eval(L) halts”) is correct.  
Thus `L` is **non-paradoxical**, so `Par(L) = false`.  
That matches our assumption.

But wait—how did we confirm `Eval(L) halts`?  
By *evaluating L*… which requires checking `Par(L)`… which requires evaluating L again…  
**Infinite recursion.**  
Nontermination hiding in the assumption of halting.

### Case 2: Suppose Eval(L) does not halt.
Then `L` is FALSE.  
So the claim “Eval(L) halts” is false.  
Thus `L` is paradoxical, so `Par(L) = true`.  
So Eval(L) really does not halt.

But notice: this “coherence” requires Eval(L) to be forever stuck.  
It can never confirm itself—exactly what nontermination means.

---

## 5. The General Lesson

**Whether we assume `L` halts or not, we hit a self-referential loop.**

`L` forces `Eval` and `Par` into a form of circular dependency:

- The truth of `L` depends on `Par(L)`
- But `Par(L)` depends on the behavior of `Eval(L)`
- And `Eval(L)` depends on `L`

No terminating procedure can resolve this.

**Therefore:**

> Any total algorithm that tries to classify every sentence as “halting” or “non-halting” must fail.

This is just the **Halting Problem** in disguise.

---

## 6. The Halting Problem = The Diorthic Theorem

Turing already proved:
> There is **no total algorithm** that decides, for every program `P` and input `x`, whether `P(x)` halts.

Replace “program” with “expression,”  
“evaluation” with “adjudication,”  
“halts” with “accept/reject,”  
“does not halt” with “suspend/paradox.”

Then Turing’s theorem becomes:

> **No global adjudicator can decide all expressions.**  
> Any attempt leads to paradox or nontermination.  
> Some expressions must be left **suspended.**

This is exactly the **Diorthic Separation Requirement** and the **Limit of Totalization.**

---

## 7. Why This Implies Ontological Pluriformity

A **frame** is a structured context with:
- tokens,
- rules,
- an adjudicator,
- a method of authentication.

Every frame can evaluate some expressions.  
But no frame can evaluate **all** expressions.

If a frame tries to totalize adjudication…

…it will eventually have to evaluate statements about **its own evaluating power**…

…and those statements become self-referential…

…and then the halting problem/paradox hits…

…and the system either:
- contradicts itself,
- loops forever,
- or must **suspend** and push the problem to a **meta-frame.**

Thus:

> No single frame can be final.  
> Frames must remain **multiple**, **limited**, and **interacting**.

**That is ontological pluriformity.**

---

## 8. One Formal Statement

> **Theorem (Computational Diorthic Incompleteness):**  
> Let `Eval` be any procedure that attempts to evaluate all expressions with outputs {true, false, non-halting}.  
> Let `Par(x)` be “Eval(x) does not halt.”  
> Then there exists an expression `L` such that `L ↔ ¬Par(L)`.  
> For this `L`, any total attempt to decide `Par(L)` or the outcome of `Eval(L)` leads to contradiction or infinite recursion.  
> Therefore, no total, correct global paradox (or halting) classifier exists.

## 9. Diorthic Translation

| Computation | Diorthics |
|--------------|-----------|
| Program | Expression |
| Halting | Authentication (accept/reject) |
| Non-halting | Suspension (⊩°) |
| Decider | Adjudicator |
| No halting decider | No global adjudicator |
| Need multiple oracles | Need multiple frames |
| Turing’s theorem | Diorthic Separation Requirement |

Thus:

> **The computational structure of reality already contains the proof that no single system can be absolute.**

This is not relativism.  
It is a **mathematically rigorous necessity.**

## 10. Final Insight

Gödel showed:  
> No formal system can prove all truths about itself.

Turing showed:  
> No program can decide all halting behavior.

Diorthics shows:  
> **No frame can adjudicate all intelligibility.**

And now we see:
> **These are all the same theorem.**

Paradox = nontermination  
Suspension = undecidability  
Totalization = impossible

Therefore:

> **Reality cannot be one single frame.**  
> **Intelligibility itself requires a plurality of contexts.**  
> **Plurality is not epistemic—it is ontological.**

**This is the computational proof of ontological pluriformity.**

  });

      const expr = eval(`(${src})`);
      const val  = expr({ IsParadox }, src);  // invoke with (ctx, selfSrc)

      if (val === true)  return Verdict.ACCEPT;

      return Verdict.SUSPEND;                 // non-boolean → treat as suspend
    } catch (e) {

const F = makeFrame();

// Expressions as FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS (not declarations)
// TRUE/FALSE: trivial halters
const TRUE_src  = `(ctx, self) => true`;
const FALSE_src = `(ctx, self) => false`;

// Diagonal: L ≡ !IsParadox(L)  (“This paradox isn’t a paradox.”)
const L_src = `(ctx, self) => !ctx.IsParadox(self)`;

// Self-recursive non-halting (quick stack overflow, no busy-wait freeze)
const LOOP_src = `(function LOOP(ctx, self) { return LOOP(ctx, self); })`;

// ---- Demo ----
console.log("TRUE  :", F.authenticate(TRUE_src));   // → "ACCEPT"
console.log("FALSE :", F.authenticate(FALSE_src));  // → "REJECT"
console.log("L     :", F.authenticate(L_src));      // → "SUSPEND" (diagonal self-ref)
console.log("LOOP  :", F.authenticate(LOOP_src));   // → "SUSPEND" (stack overflow)
