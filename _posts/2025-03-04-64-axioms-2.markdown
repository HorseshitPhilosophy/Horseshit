# Core Skeleton (v1)

### Definition 0 — Appearance / Awareness (A)
**Awareness** = the fact that anything appears at all. It’s not a substance; it’s the **condition** under which statements, observations, and theories can occur.

### Axiom 1 — Occurrence
Every statement, theory, perception, or proof **occurs within awareness** (A). There are no “free-floating” claims outside appearance.

---

### Definition 1 — Indication Frame (F)
A **frame** is a local context that fixes: (i) eligible tokens and their use, (ii) rules of inference/assessment, (iii) an **adjudicator** (what settles disputes: experiment, proof, convention, coherence), and (iv) scope/boundary.

### Axiom 2 — Frame Dependence
Every expression is **authenticated within some frame** F. Outside a frame, words don’t have settled use.

---

### Definition 2 — Expression & Authentication
An **expression** lives in the language of a frame, L(F). **Authentication** is the frame’s verdict: approve / reject / suspend.

### Definition 3 — Adjudicator Token (t₍F₎)
A frame’s adjudicator often has a token (e.g., **true**, **provable**, **heap**, **paradoxical**). It **belongs to the level that evaluates** expressions of L(F).

### Axiom 3 — No Absolute Frame
No frame can legitimately adjudicate **all** frames “from nowhere.” Cross-frame claims must **index** their scope.

---

### Definition 4 — Indexing / Meta-frame (F′)
Using an adjudicator about expressions of F **from a higher level** is **indexing** (e.g., true@F said in F′).

### Axiom 4 — Separation Requirement
Stable evaluation requires a **level distinction**: the adjudicator token for F is **not** used as an ordinary token **within** L(F) unless explicitly re-indexed.

---

### Lemma 1 — Reference Constraint (awareness talk)
Words **about** awareness can only **index** aspects the hearer can already re-instantiate. Language can’t import experiences a person has never had; it can only **point** to them via shared structure.

*Sketch:* By Axiom 2, meaning needs a frame; by Axiom 1, all frames are within awareness. If a listener lacks the experiential resources that make a token eligible in their frame, indexing fails.

### Lemma 2 — No Transparent Self-Adjudication
If an expression in L(F) tries to **use** the adjudicator token t₍F₎ **on itself** without indexing a meta-frame, authentication **cannot stabilize** (it is ineligible or oscillatory).

*Sketch:* Violates Axiom 4 (level distinction). Either the frame refuses the move (inadmissible) or evaluation cycles.

---

### Theorem 1 — Frame-Flattening Theorem (Paradox)
**Apparent paradox arises exactly when an adjudicator token is reused inside its own frame without indexing.**  
**Repair** = (i) lift to F′ (stratify), or (ii) retokenize/ban the move (grammar repair).

*Sketch:* Lemma 2 gives instability; Axiom 4 specifies why (level collapse). Lifting or retokenizing restores separation, so oscillation vanishes.

**Corollary 1 — Liar Case (plain)**
“This sentence is false.” In a classical truth frame, either (a) it’s **inadmissible** (expression-level repair), or (b) it is **true-at-meta** as a **diagnosis** of object-level failure (frame-level repair). No contradiction remains.

**Corollary 2 — Sorites (heap)**
Treating *heap* as if one crisp rule applied across shifting micro-frames flattens context. Repair by indexing (context/fuzzy) or by dual tokens (everyday-heap vs. technical-HEAP).

---

### Definition 5 — Viability
A stabilization (belief, model, practice) is **viable** iff it: (i) stays stable under modest noise, (ii) recovers after perturbation, (iii) fits overlaps with neighboring frames (consonance), and (iv) **generates** further coherent structure.

### Axiom 5 — Viability Constraint
What **endures** in discourse/practice is what is **viable** under ongoing feedback. Non-viable stabilizations collapse or get confined.

### Lemma 3 — Truth as Post-Repair Durability
Relative to an indexed frame, “true” tracks **durability under contact** **after** necessary frame repairs (stratification/retokenization) are in place.

*Sketch:* Apply Axiom 5 inside a properly separated setup (Axiom 4); “true” names the stabilized outcome.

---

### Theorem 2 — No “Absolute Metaphysics” from Inside a Frame
Any claim that legislates an **ultimate, frame-independent** picture of reality **from within** a language/frame is a case of frame-flattening. It reduces, on analysis, to either (i) indexed program (declared scope) or (ii) paradox-style collapse.

*Sketch:* Uses Axiom 3 (no absolute frame) + Theorem 1 (flattening ⇒ paradox). Indexing rescues scope-limited “metaphysics” as program/design, not doctrine.

**Corollary 3 — Why Starting from Awareness Isn’t Metaphysics**
By Axiom 1, every frame already presupposes awareness; by Theorem 2, trying to justify awareness **from outside** is incoherent. So we start from awareness not as a substance claim, but as **minimal bookkeeping** about where any saying happens.

---

### Definition 6 — Tokens (private/shared/system)
**Tokens** = reproducible cues that re-instantiate stabilizations (private habits → shared words → system symbols).

### Lemma 4 — Drift
As tokens travel across frames, their operative links **shift** (semantic drift). Successful systems **track the drift** (retokenize/index/update rules) rather than deny it.

### Theorem 3 — Communication Success Criterion
Communication succeeds when **enough of the frame** is shared to re-instantiate the intended stabilization; failure indicates **frame mismatch**, not necessarily bad faith or nonsense.

### Theorem 4 — Conceptual Homeostasis
Within awareness, stability of meaning requires ongoing adjustment of frames to preserve coherence under feedback.  
Because philosophy’s subject-matter is conceptual structure itself, its proper function is **the maintenance of viable conceptual equilibrium** — **conceptual homeostasis.**

*Sketch:*  
From Axiom 5 (viability) and Lemma 3 (truth as durability), stability = feedback-resistant coherence.  
Theorem 1 (frame-flattening) shows collapse occurs when distinctions blur; repair restores equilibrium.  
Therefore, sustained understanding depends on continuous balancing rather than on fixed foundations.

**Corollary — The Task of Philosophy**  
Philosophy’s goal is not to find immutable truths but to keep the network of meanings viable —  
to diagnose breakdowns of coherence and restore balance with minimal distortion.

### Theorem 5 — The Pseudo-Problem Principle
Every enduring philosophical “problem” results from **frame-flattening**—the unacknowledged reuse of adjudicative distinctions across incompatible frames.  

Let an expression E₁, valid within frame F₁, be used to judge E₂ within F₂ as though F₁ and F₂ shared a common adjudicator.  
Then contradiction or impasse follows.  
When the frames are re-differentiated (acknowledging distinct criteria of authentication), the apparent contradiction dissolves.

**Corollary — Philosophy as Diagnosis**
Philosophy’s task is not to resolve such pseudo-problems by further theorizing within a collapsed frame,  
but to **restore frame differentiation**—to show where language has mistaken its own limits for the limits of reality.  

**Example:**  
- Mind–body dualism: “mental” and “physical” are not competing substances but complementary frames of stabilization.  
- The Is–Ought problem: normativity cannot be derived from description because it belongs to a distinct adjudicative frame.  
- Skepticism: asking for a justification of knowledge “from outside knowledge” repeats frame-flattening.
